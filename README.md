I made a toy that not only imitates the user's words but also reads the user's facial expressions.
A cute motion of dancing while talking was also added. 

Machine learning was worked using the model ML5 in p5, and the facial expression at the 
beginning of recording was recognized. Accordingly, the pitch was adjusted so that the 
voice came out differently so that the doll could imitate the user's emotions.
